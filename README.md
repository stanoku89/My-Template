### Project Rationale
This is a very interesting and important project to help understand how command line interface works, how to open a repository and link it to gitpod. It also teaches us how to create files and folders, send them to our remote repository and then deploy our webpage. Finally the project helps us understand how to create README.md file by adding contents that describes the project to the markdown.
